**Title:** A Causal framework for interpreting model representations

**Abstract:** 
There is a growing interest in providing explanations of machine learning models using human-understandable concepts. This integration of concepts can alleviate model opacity due to neural networks opening new venues to design interpretable and trustworthy models. However a critical problem is ensuring that machine learning models successfully encode the human concepts in their representations in a correct manner. Specifically when can we assign names to machine representations and how well do their concepts align with ours? I will demonstrate how Causality and Causal Representation Learning can help formalize this problem offering a clear definition of what can be referred to as human-machine alignment. Throughout the presentation I will showcase examples of both successes and failures in models designed to integrate concepts into their representations.

We look forward to seeing you at the seminar!

Best,

Causal Club
