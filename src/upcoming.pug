        | Causal discovery from observational data is hindered by restrictive modelling hypotheses that may be unrealistic and hard to verify. In this talk, we will illustrate how score matching estimation enables causal discovery with observational data on broad classes of causal models, with linear and nonlinear mechanisms, even in the presence of latent confounders. We draw the connection between our findings and the general principles that underlie most of the known results on the identifiability of causal models from observational data. Then, we turn our attention to supervised learning-based approaches for causal discovery: a plethora of learning algorithms for the amortized inference of causal graphs have been recently proposed, accompanied by impressive empirical results. Yet, it is unclear when the output of these methods can be trusted, as they do not come with clear identifiability guarantees. We show that amortized causal discovery still needs to obey identifiability theory, but it also differs from classical methods in how the assumptions are formulated, trading more reliance on assumptions on the noise type for fewer hypotheses on the mechanisms.
