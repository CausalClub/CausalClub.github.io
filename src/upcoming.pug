        | Causal graphical models encode causal relationships between variables, typically based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Structural causal models expand upon this by expressing the causal relationships as explicit functions, which allows for computing the effect of interventions and much more. We show that, in many common parameterizations using linear functions and additive noise, effects accumulate along the causal order. This property enables inferring the causal order from data simply by sorting by a suitable criterion. We introduce the concept of sortability to capture the magnitude of the phenomenon, and show that the accumulating effects can lead to unrealistic values and deterministic relationships. We discuss implications for existing results and future research based on the same model class.
